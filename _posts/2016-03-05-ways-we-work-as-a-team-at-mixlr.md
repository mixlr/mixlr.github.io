At Mixlr, we’ve racked up over five years of experience working as a team to create an amazing service.

Along the way, we’ve also accumulated a few tips and tricks to help us do it on a day-to-day basis. Here’s some of our favourites.

#### In-office sound effects

We use Slack for group chat at Mixlr, ever since migrating away from the erstwhile number one Campfire.

Slack has proven infinitely more useful (and addictive), but there’s one thing we missed - Campfire’s sound effects.

There’s nothing like being able to instantly drop a sad trombone into conversation to help make one’s point. So we decided to act.

Our team member Konrad --- with the help of a Raspberry Pi, the Go programming language and Slack’s command API --- built an ingenious custom sound effects system that allows any of our team to use Slack to trigger a library of custom sound effects over the office sound system.

Here’s a video of it in action.

#### 1-to-1s

Every fortnight, each member of the Mixlr team gets away from their desks and spends an hour chatting --- one-to-one --- with their first-contact manager.

The subject of the meeting varies, but is ultimately entirely up to the team member: it’s their time to discuss on-going projects, vent about any frustrations they may have, or ask questions about anything and everything.

We’re still in the early days of our adoption of 1-to-1s, but we’re already seeing some profoundly positive benefits: new lines of communication being opened up, and interesting and valuable discussions which quite likely would otherwise never have occurred.

#### Real-time customer milestones

It's a nice feeling when the work you've done has led to a new customer signing up, or a user sending us an appreciative email.

We try to make the most of this by having key customer milestones posted automatically into Slack.

#### Daily standup

A standup is one of the most commonly known agile methodologies. 


#### Friday beers + tech talks

Come the depths of Friday afternoon, it’s not normal to remain fully focused on work.
