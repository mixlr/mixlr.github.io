We would like to meet frontend web developers who are passionate about great design, beautiful user interfaces - and want the opportunity to work on an exciting, high-traffic real-time web application.

[Mixlr](http://mixlr.com) powers tens of thousands of broadcasts every month, attracting millions of listeners and an engaged and passionate community of content creators. You will be primarily working on our public-facing web applications, building great new features and ensuring our community continues to enjoy a fantastic user experience.

You'll be collaborating daily with our product design team and founders, offering the opportunity to directly influence not just the codebase but our wider product and business decisions too.

We are proud to be an open and friendly team. With regular Friday beers featuring technical discussion and presentations, and pair-programming opportunities, you'll not just contribute but also learn a lot.

We use agile methodologies to guide our development process, and weâ€™ll aim for you to deploy to our production site on your very first day.

Some of the technologies we use every day:
