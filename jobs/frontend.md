At Mixlr we currently have opportunities to join our team as a frontend developer.

#### About Mixlr

#### About the role

As a frontend developer, your role will be building, testing and enhancing user-facing features for the Mixlr website.

We pride ourselves on delivering fantastic visual design and faultless user experience. You’ll be collaborating directly with our product and design teams to build, test and fine-tune new features using Ruby, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS.

You will own your own code throughout the product development process, so your responsibilities will include writing automated tests, and also talking with our users to listen to their concerns and fix problems they encounter.

Mixlr’s large and active user base will regularly provide instant feedback on the changes you make, providing a fast feedback loop which makes working at Mixlr challenging, exhilarating and satisfying.

We offer a friendly and positive team environment. With regular Friday beers featuring technical discussion and presentations, and regular pair-programming opportunities, you'll not just contribute but also learn a lot.
