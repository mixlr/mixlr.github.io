[Mixlr](http://mixlr.com) is the biggest platform for live music and audio content, now with over 4 million registered users and 40,000 active broadcasters every month.

With our desktop, tablet and mobile apps our community can broadcast live to the world with one touch of a button. Once live, itâ€™s easy for friends and followers to chat, heart and share - becoming a part of the live event themselves.

Founded in 2010 by Greg Lloyd and Rob Watson, we are an established startup and growing fast. With a small, tight-knit team you will have the opportunity to make a great impact not only on the code but also on our product, company and future.

Part of our product lineup:

* [Web application](http://mixlr.com) _(Ruby on Rails, Ruby, RSpec, Resque, JavaScript, Backbone)_

* Embeddable player _(HTML5, JavaScript)_
* Real-time push messaging service _(NodeJS, Redis, WebSockets)_
* Streaming backend infrastructure _(NodeJS, JavaScript, Java, Icecast)_
