At Mixlr we currently have opportunities to join our team as a C++ Developer.

#### About Mixlr

#### About the role

With tens of thousands of monthly active users, and as the main point of entry for all live audio content on our service --- our [broadcast app](http://mixlr.com/broadcast) is arguably the single most important product in the Mixlr arsenal.

As a C++ Developer at Mixlr, your main role will be to focus on iterating and improving on our broadcast app. Working in close collaboration with our product and design teams, you will implement new features while ensuring that the functionality and reliability of the app remains faultless.

To ease the process of cross-platform development, we make use of recent versions of the [Qt framework](http://www.qt.io/).

Experience working with audio and/or video processing or digital signal processing is an advantage, but not a prerequisite.

We offer a friendly and positive team environment. With regular Friday beers featuring technical discussion and presentations, and regular pair-programming opportunities, you'll not just contribute but also learn a lot.
