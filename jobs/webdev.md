[Mixlr](http://mixlr.com) is the biggest platform for live music and audio content, now with over 4 million registered users and 40,000 active broadcasters every month.

With our desktop, tablet and mobile apps our community can broadcast live to the world with one touch of a button. Once live, it’s easy for friends and followers to chat, heart and share - becoming a part of the live event themselves.

Founded in 2010 by Greg Lloyd and Rob Watson, we are an established startup and growing fast. You would join us as the fifth engineer in our team, and as such have a great impact not only on the code but also on the future of our product and company.

Part of our product lineup:

* [Web application](http://mixlr.com) _(Ruby on Rails, Ruby, RSpec, Resque, JavaScript, Backbone)_
* Desktop app for Windows and Mac _(C++, Qt, QML)_
* Native [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mixlr.android&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mixlr-social-live-audio/id583705714?mt=8) apps _(Objective C, Java, Android Studio, Gradle)_
* Embeddable player _(HTML5, JavaScript)_
* Real-time push messaging service _(NodeJS, Redis, WebSockets)_
* Streaming backend infrastructure _(NodeJS, JavaScript, Java, Icecast)_

On top of that our stack also features: PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, Lua, Puppet and AWS.

Some tools we use in our daily workflow: Slack, Git, GitHub, Pivotal Tracker, Trello, Pingdom, BrowserStack.

#### Ruby/Rails developer

We would like to meet Ruby/Rails developers who can work in a fast-paced environment, are proficient in their trait but also passionate about learning new skills. We use agile methodologies to guide our development process, and we’ll aim for you to deploy to our live site on your very first day.

Still not convinced? We also offer:

* A small, tight-knit team and a fun (but focused) working environment
* A [great office](http://eatworkart.com/netil-house/), plus [spectacular rooftop terrace and bar](https://www.instagram.com/p/8FkTZSo9M0/?taken-by=netil360) - perfectly situated in the heart of East London
* Friday beers with technical talks to share our knowledge
* Flexible working hours
* A grown and battle-proven stack and infrastructure to extend and learn from
* Fast feedback-loop: every change has a direct impact on our users
* The opportunity to have an actual impact with the work you are doing
* Office stereos with rotating DJs in the team
* In-office sound effects which can be triggered from Slack

_We are hiring for frontend, backend and full-stack positions._
