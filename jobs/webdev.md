We would like to meet Ruby developers who are passionate, proficient - and hungry to learn new skills.

You will be working primarily on our hugely popular and high-traffic Ruby on Rails web app. With a small, tight-knit team and a large and passionate user base, your work will have an instant impact from your very first day.

You'll also be collaborating directly with our product design team, and founders, on a day-to-day basis, and thus have the opportunity to directly influence the future of our product and company.

We are proud to be a friendly and positive team, and value learning and sharing our knowledge highly. With regular Friday beers featuring technical discussion and presentations, pair-programming opportunities and an extensive and battle-proven technical infrastructure, you'll learn (and contribute) a lot.

We use agile methodologies to guide our development process, and weâ€™ll aim for you to deploy to our production site on your very first day.

_We are hiring for frontend, backend and full-stack web developer roles._

Some of the technologies we use every day:

<div class="info_block">
Ruby on Rails, Rspec, PostgreSQL, Redis, Resque, Git, Slack, Stripe, Haml, SCSS, Mustache, NodeJS, Airbrake, WebSockets, OAuth2, Mailgun, Capistrano, Machinist, and lots more...
</div>

We also offer a competitive salary and equity package. [Learn more about Mixlr and our working environment](/jobs).
