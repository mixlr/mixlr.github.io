At Mixlr we currently have opportunities to join our team as a DevOps Engineer.

#### About Mixlr

#### About the role

As a DevOps engineer, your day-to-day focus will be the nuts and bolts that keeps Mixlr running.

As a live broadcasting service used by tens of thousands of broadcasters every week, reliability is critical to us. Youâ€™ll work on an extensive and battle-hardened stack, but also bring new insights into how we can further improve and optimise our systems.

Solving tough problems using technology and inventiveness is at the heart of our company. Whether you find yourself developing new ways to deploy and monitor web applications, or scaling streaming servers to handle tens of thousands of concurrent connections --- you can expect the work to be varied, and to require much creativity and skill.

We strive to make use of the best open source technology: [Linux](https://www.linux.com/), [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and more. Mixlr is deployed across [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and third-party dedicated hosting providers.

We offer a friendly and positive team environment. With regular Friday beers featuring technical discussion and presentations, and regular pair-programming opportunities, you'll not just contribute but also learn a lot.
