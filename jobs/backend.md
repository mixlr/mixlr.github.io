At Mixlr we currently have opportunities to join our team as a backend developer.

#### About Mixlr

{% include jobs/about_mixlr.html %}

#### About the role

As a backend developer, you will design, build and optimise systems, identify and fix scalability and security issues, and work to enhance Mixlrâ€™s overall infrastructure.

Your focus will be on our Ruby on Rails web applications, and also our other backend services providing live streaming, real-time messaging, background processing, autoscaling, monitoring and lots more. These services are mostly written in Ruby and NodeJS, but you will be expected to learn about and dive into other programming environments when needed too.

You will own your code from design to deployment phase and beyond. To support this, we implement automatic testing for everything we can, and place a high importance on building ourselves the best internal monitoring tools possible.

We offer a friendly and positive team environment. With regular Friday beers featuring technical discussion and presentations, and regular pair-programming opportunities, you'll not just contribute but also learn a lot.
