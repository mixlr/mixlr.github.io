#### About Mixlr

{% include jobs/about_mixlr.html %}

#### About the role

Mixlr’s web and mobile applications are used by millions of broadcasters and listeners each month.

As Product Manager, you will first seek to deeply understand our users and their requirements - and how these needs relate to our longer term business goals. This process should be driven by a mixture of quantitative and qualitative feedback.

Building on this, you will then guide the design and development of our product suite. You will define new features across our apps using specs, user stories and wireframes --- and also manage our longer term strategic product roadmap.

You will make informed decisions to ensure that we ship relevant and effective features of the highest quality --- and that we do so while meeting the deadline. This will involve ruthless prioritisation and organisation of the product load, and the ability to work closely and effectively with our development team throughout the product lifecycle.

As the first Product Manager to join Mixlr, you will have an opportunity to lay the foundations and shape how Mixlr builds product. This is an opportunity to have a huge impact at an exciting and fast growing technology company.

#### Your responsibilities will include...

Defining new features across the suite of Mixlr apps through specs, user stories and wireframes.

Developing and maintaining the Mixlr product roadmap.

Ensuring we ship the highest quality products within deadlines.

#### Experience required...

At least 3 years Product Management experience working on a consumer or enterprise tech product.

Exceptional and clear communication skills.

A basic understanding of data analysis to support data-informed decision making.

A bachelor’s degree (or equivalent work experience).

<br/>
Audio / music background is a plus.
