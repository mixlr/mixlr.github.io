We would like to meet backend and full-stack developers who are all about implementing rock-solid systems, and who want to apply their skills in the exciting and challenging field of live broadcasting.

Mixlr powers tens of thousands of broadcasts every month, attracting millions of listeners and an engaged and passionate community of content creators. You will have the opportunity to work both on our Ruby on Rails apps, and also our extensive and battle-tested backend infrastructure.

We practice test-driven development wherever possible, and place a high importance on building ourselves the best internal monitoring tools we can. You'll be collaborating daily with our product design team, and founders, offering the opportunity to directly influence not just the codebase but the future of our product and company.

We are proud to be a friendly and positive team. With regular Friday beers featuring technical discussion and presentations, pair-programming opportunities, you'll not just contribute but also learn a lot.

We use agile methodologies to guide our development process, and weâ€™ll aim for you to deploy to our production site on your very first day.
